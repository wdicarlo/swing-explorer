OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Swing Explorer is a tool for Swing developers intended for visual exploring of Swing-based application internals. \
    It finds all windows in explored Swing application and displays their component hierarchies as a tree. \
    Each component in the tree can be displayed in the Swing Explorer's work area and visually inspected. \
    Swing Explorer helps to determine sub-components when user moves mouse over them and provides additional information about currently selected component (layout, size, coordinates, border and other things). \
    Additionally it allows to view basic graphical operations used to draw swing components like DebugGraphics does, but in more convenient way. \
    The screenshot illustrates how Swing Explorer looks like.
